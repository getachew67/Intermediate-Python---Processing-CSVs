# Intermediate-Python---Processing-CSVs - Homework 2

## Goals:
  ### Use Python to review CS1 programming concepts and implement programs that follow a specification, including:
    Use/manipulation of various data types including numbers and strings.
    Control structures (conditional statements, loops, parameters, returns) to implement basic functions provided by a specification.
    Basic text file processing.
    Documenting code.
  ### Write unit tests to test each function written including their edge cases.
  ### Work with data structures (lists, sets, dictionaries) in Python
  ### Process structured data in Python with CSV files as input with and without a library (Pandas)
    Handle edge cases appropriately, including addressing missing values/data
    Practice user-friendly error-handling
  ### Apply programming to identify and investigate a question on a dataset using basic statistical concepts (e.g. mean, max)
